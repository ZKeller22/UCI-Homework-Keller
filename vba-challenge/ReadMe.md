This folder contains my project creating a VBA script that will run through each year tab on a spreadsheet and out put on the right side of the data set the change in price, change in percent and sum of volume traded per ticker.

The value in column J will change color depending on if the change in price was negative or positive.

Additionally, the script will look through the yearly summation per ticker and output the greatest total volume, max and min price change and percent change to the righ of the summmation by ticker.
